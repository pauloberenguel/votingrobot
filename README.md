# votingrobot
Small project to send multiple votes in a given website using either Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. 
This voting competition allowed multiple votes per user and there were no restriction in using robots for it. 
Use it ethically. I could also implement a captcha solving to this code for educational purposes in future, just let me know.
